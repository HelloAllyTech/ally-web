## Git Conventions

### Branch Naming

Branches should follow this naming convention:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

**Rules:**

- Use **hyphens** to separate words in the description (not underscores)
- Keep descriptions short and descriptive
- Use lowercase letters

#### Branch Types

| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks, dependency updates             |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without changing functionality |
| `docs`     | Documentation updates                             |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                          |
| `style`    | Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc.         |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                          |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependency changes       |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                            |
| `revert`   | Reverting previous commits                        |

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>: short summary
```

#### Guidelines

- Use **imperative tone** (e.g., "add" not "added")
- Keep the summary short and descriptive
- First letter lowercase after the type
- No period at the end

#### Examples

```
feat: add user profile page
fix: handle invalid token error
refactor: optimize data fetching
perf: improve image loading speed
docs: update contribution guide
test: add missing unit tests
ci: update build pipeline
style: fix code formatting

```
